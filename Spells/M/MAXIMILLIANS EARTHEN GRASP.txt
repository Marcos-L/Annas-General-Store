{"Name":"Maximillians Earthen Grasp\r","Lv":"Level 2 (CVSM)","Range":"Range=30 feet.","Mat":"a miniature hand sculpted from clay","Desc":"Takes 1 action to cast and lasts for 1 minute\nYou choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.\nAs an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nTo break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.\nAs an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.\r","Tags":["Concentration"]}
