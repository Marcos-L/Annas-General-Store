{"Name": "Bag of Beans", "Price": "??", "Desc": "Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.  If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.  If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an Effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an Effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an Effect.", "Tags": []}
